- The authors view of women:
	- Respectfull
	- Men can find Serenity, through Woman.

The commentator says the god's names are meaningful (sānvayā)

- Requirments
	- The yoginī (female practitioner, called the "Wisdom" *prajñā*):
		- Must be menstruating.
		- The text isn't clear on whether she has to be an initiate or not.
			- Some passages essentially say she can be any woman: "She can be a mother, daughter, younger sister, niece, a female relative, entertainer, relative of a brahmin [i.e. high class], street sweeper [i.e. low class], dancer, washerwoman, prostitute, nun, yoginī, ascetic". The passage even goes on to say if the yogī cannot find a woman then "anything prettied up to look like a one will suffice". 
			- Yet other passages appear to require the yoginī to be adept in visualization AND WHAT ELSE
	- The Yogī (male practitioner, called the "Means" *upāya*) must have:
		- **Training**
			- Has to be a high ranking initiate in Tibetan Vajrayana Buddhism. Vajrayana was already esoteric compared to the other branches of buddhism (Mahayana, Theravada). Add to this that this is suppose to be for *high ranking* Vajrayana buddhists. The text says the yogī must be of the "Perfected" [rank](perfected-rank.md), and he should study with dedication, immersion, and single-mindedness.
			- Even today if you go to buddhist websites they have red warning labels on the top of the page indicating that one needs to undergo training by a guru before reading it:  <img width="40%" src="https://i.imgur.com/AkrjW4H.png"></img>
			- This esoterism was doubtless partly because of the sexual nature of the ritual, but there were other reasons it was meant only for advanced initiates as well: namely, *the methods required a great deal of preperation and practice* 
				- (1) Practicing **Visualization** with the yoginī. He must be able to visualize himself as ([*Caṇḍa­roṣaṇa*](acala.md) and her as [Prajñāpāramitā](Prajñāpāramitā.md)). He should repeatedly practice--with patience and uninterupted focus--until the mental image becomes perfectly clear.
				- (2) Learning how to [**Edge**](edging.md) with the guru-master.
				- (3) Studying various sex [**positions**](positions.md) by drawing them on clay tablets.
				- Even if a practition was initiated and studied, there was one remain requirement: they had to be inconsolably horny (*magaraga* "[of] Great Passion"). Hence the name of the he ritual: The Way of Great Passion (*mahārāganaya*).
		- **A Personality full of Desire *kāma* & Passion *rāga* (from the root √*rañj* "red")**
			- Specifically for the woman, he must find her attractive.
			- In buddhism *kāma* and *rāga* are usually negative.
			- In the ritual, this passion in question is transmuted towards spiritual ends. During the ritual one's actions are indeed very passionate (clawing, spitting, talking dirty), but the poetic dialogue and mental visualizations direct those passions towards various often higher ends, such as: (1) adoration of women; (2) imagining one's self as a perfected god; and (3) breaking down the illusory mental conception that we are seperate from one another, that is, *dualism*. 
		- **Knowledge** (*jñāna*)
			- You must *not* have doubts (*vicikitsa*), because then you will not have faith (*śraddhā*) in this teaching (*dharme*)
			- You Must have faith (*śraddhā*) in this method.


- If this ritual/way/path allows one to attain--in this very lifetime/incarnation--the "state of Caṇḍa­mahā­roṣaṇa", which includes:
			- (a) Great Serenity [*mahā-sukha*](sukha.md)
			- (b) Bliss [*ānanda*](ānanda.md) (Understanding reality)[^2]
				- The commentator explains that different practicioners achieve Joy at different times during the sexual ritual:
				- Superior Beings (*adhimātra*) experience *ānanda* "Bliss" right away (during foreplay up to penetration).
				- Advanced Beings (*madhya*) experience *paramānanda* "Supreme Bliss" during sex and before ejaculating
				- Beginners (*mṛdu*) experience "Innate Bliss" (*sahajānandaḥ*) during ejaculation ( a supreme kind of pleasure, devoid of the concepts of subject-object-perception)
				- After ejaculation, after a few moments, the yogī will realize ‘I have experienced pleasure’ (*sukhaṃ bhuktaṃ mayā*) and thereafter experience The Bliss of Cessation (*viramānandaḥ*) 
			- (c) Powers [*siddhīḥ*](siddhi.md)
				- the goal of *sādhana* (practice involving mantra and visualization)
				-  “I have taught this practice In order to grant accomplishment (siddhi) to the passionate (*rāga*) ones." (6.­79)

- If you lack one of these things you will not Succeed in gaining Powers (siddhi).
	- **If you lack Knowledge** *jñāna*, you will gain nothing and remain of the World ([[ṣaḍgati]] ). 
	- **If you lack Passion** (*mahā-rāga*), you *can* still attain awakening [*bodhi*?] through non-tantric exoteric Mahāyāna Buddhism (specifically, [*pāramitānaya*](https://www.wisdomlib.org/definition/paramitanaya#buddhism) Mahāyāna), **but** it will take "Three Uncountable Aeons" (*trikalpāsaṃkhyeyena*). It can be achieved faster by the Way of Great Passion.
				- Beceause of their numerous doubts (*vicikitsa*), they do not have faith (*śraddhā*) in this teaching (*dharme*). 
				- Whether the buddhist practitioner was Passonate or not, the commentator says they had to have faith (*śraddhā*)
	- **If you lack Faith** *śraddhā*, or have faith in another method--even if you are desirous *kāma* of Powers!--you will not attain Powers. In the same what that if you want butter you must churn milk not water. It is because of the nature of things (i.e. *vastuśakti* the inherent power of things).


[^2]: There were aparently differing views on the order. Mahāsukhavajra sided with what Isaacson & Sferra call “position A” regarding the order of Blisses, the other, “position B” being that *sahajānandaḥ* is the fourth and *viramānandaḥ* , possibly in a different sense (i.e. not ‘cessation’), is the third. For more infomation see: Isaacson, H., & Sferra, F. (2014). *The Sekanirdeśa of Maitreyanātha (Advayavajra) with the Sekanirdeśapañjikā of Rāmapāla, Critical Edition of the Sanskrit and Tibetan Texts with English Translation and Reproductions of the MSS*.

- Both
		- Must be able to visualize each other as deities (here [*Caṇḍa­roṣaṇa*](acala.md) and [Prajñāpāramitā](Prajñāpāramitā.md)). They should repeatedly practice--with patience and uninterupted focus--until the mental image becomes perfectly clear. [WHAT DO THEY LOOK LIKE? DESCRIPTION IN EARLIER CHAPTER?]
		- Must be *atyantakāminām* Exceedingly Desirous and *rāga* Passionate. In non-tantric buddhism these are vices.
		- Must [visualize](perfected-rank.md) each other as deities. [The text doesn't explictly say the woman has to, but it makes way more sense given the dialogue for her to.]
		- Must "do this secretly. If others find out, [­I](acala.md) will be angry. He will brandish a sword and noose, and kill the yogi, casting him into The Avīci Hell. There will be no attainment for him in this world or the next. Therefore one should maintain absolute secrecy and stay out of sight."
		- Must perform this in "a comfortable place free of distraction". The text says at least a room, at most a hermitage. Whatever the place it should be stocked with some food and clothing.

[VY's essence is "great passion" (*maharaga*]


What is the ritual's purpose?
- Liberation, Merit
- He should contemplate the pleasure produced by that in [meditative] union [unwavering absorption] [with Caṇḍa[mahā]roṣaṇa. 
- Then the yogī will be liberated, free from all mental constructs. Making his mind devoid of aversion (free from indifference), he should make love to the mother. By following lust (passionate affection), merit is obtained/acquired; from aversion demerit accrues (there is no greater evil than the absence of passion, of indifference). There is no greater evil than indifference, no greater merit than pleasure [WORD?]. And therefore he should concentrate/focus one's mind upon the pleasure arising from desire (6.91) WORD? arising from desire WORD?.
