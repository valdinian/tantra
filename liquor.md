> A woman who is on the Kula Path [of the Yoginī clans] (_kulamārga_), who avoids the path of bound souls (_paśumārga_) [i.e. the path of the uninitiated], who is drunk, and is free of the bonds that fetter the soul (_paśupāśa_), and whose mind is filled with the bliss of wine (_madirā_), is [called] a Yoginī in Śiva’s teaching. ([[Matsyendrasaṃhitā]] 40.40–41ab)
