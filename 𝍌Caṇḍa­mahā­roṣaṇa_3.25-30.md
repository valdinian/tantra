[[📕Caṇḍa­mahā­roṣaṇa-tantra]] > Ch. 3 "Empowerment"

> Next the teacher should whisper into the disciple’s ear about the division of the four joys. Then the teacher should go out. The wisdom consort should undress and, lying on her back, point to her secret place, saying: 
⠀
"My dear, are you eager
To eat my impurities,
Even if they were feces, urine, and blood,
And suck the interior of my bhaga?"
⠀
The sādhaka should say:
⠀
"Why wouldn’t I be eager, O mother,
To eat your impurities?
I should practice devotion to women
Until I attain the essence of awakening."
⠀
And she should say:
⠀
"Ah, whoever serves,
According to procedure, this lotus of mine,
Which is endowed with every pleasure,
To him I will grant accomplishment.
Do what needs to be done in the lotus,
Steadily, applying forethought,
For Caṇḍa­mahā­roṣaṇa himself
Dwells here‍—the great bliss."
⠀
Then the sādhaka, visualizing himself in the form of Caṇḍa­mahā­roṣaṇa and visualizing the wisdom consort in the form of Hatred Vajrī, should make love and note the four joys. When this is completed, he should offer the gaṇacakra feast with wine and meat, with the teacher as the guest of honor. This was the wisdom empowerment.
