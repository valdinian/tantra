# *Caṇḍa­mahā­roṣaṇatantra* Ch. 6: The Ritual of Great Passion (*mahārāganaya*) 
***
## Edition
- I made more than just a translation of chapter 6:
	- I combined: (1) The original text; (2) Mahāsukhavajra's ancient *commentary* on the text; and (3) Grimes & Szántó's modern scholarly notes; into a single readable thought-for-thought screenplay. 
	- I rearranged some parts. Originally ch. 6 actually contained two rituals (what I call 6a & 6b). I moved the part in 6a about consuming urine and feces to Ritual 7, and I moved the sex-positions listed in 6b to 6a. Why? To maintain thematic consistency. 6a seems[^1] to have been about sex and sexual fluids, while 7 seems to have been more about the Yogī consuming the impurities of the consort to revitalize himself (hence the original title "Revitalizing the Body").
	- I'm comfortable with these changes partly because the author author repeatedly leaves details up the practitioner: ("...etc."; "The yogī should say somthing *like*..."; "He should say *arousing words*..."; even "this is an Example (*upalakṣaṇam*) what the kind of thing to do").
	- I did not *add* anything. Nor did I *remove* anything major. All the original texts (in English, Sanskrit, and Tibetan) can be found online for free:

[^1]: Here's a full comparison: <code> Discharge 6a / Menses 6a / Semen 6a / Gunk 6a / Phlegm 6a, 7 / Leftovers 6b, 7 / Urine 6a, 7 / Feces 6a, 7 / Vomit 7 / Mouth-washwater 7 / Lotus-washwater 7 / Anus-washwater 7 </code> In short, the focus of ritual 7 "The Revitalization of the Body" is eating and drinking sustenance, while ritual 6a "Perfection (i.e. Visualization) Rank" is more about the consort's body itself. The rituals 6a, 6b,  and 7 might have even been written back-to-back, no one knows. The order I settled on is: <code>First [6a - U&F]  then [7 + U&F]</code>.

### Frame-Story In Heaven
The [bountiful](bhagavat.md) goddess [[Prajñāpāramitā]] held tight the [bountiful](bhagavat.md) god [[Caṇḍa­mahā­roṣaṇa]]., rubbed her [Lotus](vagina.md) with his [Vajra](phallus.md), and asked him: “How should a Yogī meditate, once he has achieved the "Perfected" [rank](perfected-rank.md)? For the Yoginī's benefit, please answer my question.” The Lord replied [with the explaination of the ritual below (->[[#Part 2: The Ritual]]) ].  After he explained the ritual, she joyfully praised him and asked: 

> "O God, is this method to gain [Power](siddhi.md) for mortals only, or is it for others as well?" 
 
The God replied: 

> All [practitioners](sādhaka.md)--no matter where they are in the universe, no matter if they are men, gods, demons, or nāgas--if they are [Passionate](rakta.md) can develop [Powers](siddhi.md).

Upon hearing this, every god--as numerous as the grains of sand in the Gaṅgā--took a goddess by the hand  and sat, each according to rank. Above the [minor gods](minor-gods.md), the Four High Gods, and above them the enlightened [Tathāgatas](Tathāgatas.md). The group ritual was led by the Four High Gods, and all the couples, through harnessing [Passion](rāga.md), developed [Powers](siddhi.md) and evolved into new forms:

- **Shiva** (*maheśvara* "Great Lord") became Vajraśaṃkara, and his consort **Parvati** (Gaurī) became Vajragaurī. He became a Skull-Bearer<sup>*Kāpālika*</sup>; smeared his body with arm and matted his hair. He adorned himself with bone beads, armlets, girlde, and necklace. On his head he placed a cresent moon and jewled crown. With his left hand he held a drum. She became sixteen years old, with skin the color of molten gold; and her body adorned with ornaments. In her left hand she held a red lotus. They sat crossed-legged mounted upon the bull Nandi.
- **Viṣṇu** (Vāsudeva) became Vajranārāyaṇa, and **Lakshmi** (*Laksmī*) became Vajralaksmī. He became dark blue, four-armed; adorned with ornaments, and crowned with jewels. With two arms he wielded gem and mace, with two others conch and discus. She becomes sixteen years old, with white skin. Ornaments adorn her whole body, and in her left hand she holds a red lotus. They sat cross-legged, mounted upon the eagle Garuda. 
- **Indra** (Devendra) became Vajrapāṇi ("Vajra Handed"), and **Śacī**/Indrāṇī became Vajraśacī ("Formless Vajra"). He became golden, thousand-eyed, adorned with ornaments, and crowned with jewels. Weilding lightening he threatens those who look upon him. She became sixteen years old, with skin the colour of molten gold. Ornaments adorned her whole body, and in her left hand she holds a red lotus. They sat cross-legged, mounted upon the elephant Airāvana. 
- **Kama** (deva) became Vajrānaṅga, and **Ratī** became Vajraratī. He became yellow; His body adorned with various ornaments; a jeweled crown upon his head. Wielding arrow and flower. She became sixteen years old, with skin the colour of molten gold. Ornaments adorned her whole body, and in her left hand she holds a red lotus. They sat cross-legged, mounted upon a ﬂying palace (*vimāna*) decorated with sea monsters (*[makara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Makara)*).

In these forms, sexually united, crosslegged (i.e. *yab-yum* [position](https://www.google.com/search?q=yab-yum&tbm=isch)), and sitting upon their [Heavenly Mounts](vahana.md) the gods descended to the earth. Their new corporeal forms endowed them with the Five Senses, and therefore with Desire (*kāmāḥ*). Yet they were not stained by Faults (dóṣa). They were conquerors in disguise (*māyāvin*).

[The text isn't clear if they descend to *possess* the yogis during the ritual or not]

Instead, he should instantly visualise himself and his consort with whatever colour, shape, etc. feels natural.
