## Notes
- Edition: 
	- Text available here: [Eng](https://read.84000.co/translation/UT22084-080-015.html#UT22084-080-015-chapter-7) [Skt](https://read.84000.co/translation/UT22084-080-015.html#UT22084-080-015-appendix-7). 
	- This pages actually includes some passages from chapter 6 as well, specifically the Urine & Feces portion near the beginning of Ritual 6a, and the entirety of Ritual 6b. I explain why here: [[üìÑCa·πá·∏ça¬≠mahƒÅ¬≠ro·π£a·πáa-6#Footnotes]] "1."
- Why "meditate on violence"? Gets the practitioners in an animalistic headspace, easier to break down boundaries.

## Translation
### Frame-Story In Heaven
Then [Praj√±ƒÅpƒÅramitƒÅ](Praj√±ƒÅpƒÅramitƒÅ.md) said: 

> ‚ÄúThe fatigue of any person practicing sexual intercourse would be great. Please deign to explain, O lord, for everybody‚Äôs sake, how to remove this fatigue.‚Äù 

[Ca·πá·∏ça¬≠mahƒÅ¬≠ro·π£a·πáa](acala.md) replied: 

> ‚ÄúWhen one has noticed, with one‚Äôs own senses, that the pleasure given by the woman has died out, one should [perform [[#Ritual 7]] below]. [...] Just as, after applying compost, the tree will bear more fruit, in exactly the same way, by parking of these impurities, people will obtain the genuine fruit of pleasure. For such people, there is neither old age, nor disease, nor death. Whoever applies himself to these impurities will suceed, even if he does not practice yoga. One should never think whether something is edible or not. Likewise a yoga adept should not think in terms of something being proper or improtper to do, or someone being suitable or unsuitable for making love to. There is neither merit nor sin; one should not think about higher realms or liberation. Instead one should remain of one nature with innate joy, well focused. The yogin who practices yoga in this way, wholly devoted to his meditation, and maintaining the right identification through the practice of being one with Ca·πá·∏çamahƒÅro·π£a·πáa, would not be stained by sin even if he were to kill one hundred brahmins. One should therefore meditate on Ca·πá·∏çamahƒÅro·π£a·πáa, a protector such as described, and violent acts, that would lead ordinary people to hell, will, when joined with this skillful means, lead him to liberation without a doubt. All this is preceded by mind; And judged nonvirtuous or virtuous. Forms created by the mind vary according to one's place of birth, in the same way that, if one eats a poison not incanted with the mantra, one's life will wane, but after incanting the same poison with a mantra, one's happiness and lifespan will increase."

Then, at this moment, the supreme goddess, Praj√±ƒÅpƒÅramitƒÅ, with a knife and a skull cup in her hands, and with Ca·πá·∏çamahƒÅro·π£a·πáa as the seal upon her head, Vajra-fierce, very angry, spoke these highest words: 

> "Meditating on my form and identifying perfectly with me, she will not be stained by sin, even if she should kill one hundred brahmins. Having assumed my form, with great wrath alone in her mind, the yoginƒ´ may kill fish and birds, and she will not be stained. For all women are generally without compassion, fickle and irritable, with their thoughts on the profits derived from killing--for their sake, this explanation was made."

### Ritual 7
After resting, ==They== should perform this ritual while meditating on the violent [mandala](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Candamaharosana-mandala-This-portrayal-is-slightly-different-from-what-is-prescribed-in_fig2_339889004) of Ca·πá·∏çamahƒÅro·π£a·πáa.
1. ==He== should prepare a meal (of fish, meat, boiled grain, etc) and drink (water, milk, and especially wine).
1. ==She== should eat.
	1. Note: She should drink alchohol in moderation, not because it is a sin, but because it can effect concentration. She should drink enough to "achieve the desired effect" (lowered boundaries, arousal)
2. ==He== should consume her impurities with focus and without restraint, not thinking whether it's taboo or not:
3. ...eat her leftovers (in fact, he should always only eat from her dish of leftovers).
4. ...drink [the water she washes he mouth with](mouth-wash-water.md)
5. ...drink [the water she washes her Lotus with](lotus-wash-water.md) (in fact, he should always only drink water she either washes her mouth or lotus with) 
6. ...rinse his mouth with [the water she washes her anus with](anus-wash-water.md). 
7. ...swallow: Skt. "lumps of her [phlegm](phlegm.md)" ; Tib. "saliva"
8. ...drink [the water born from her vulva](urine.md)
9. ...eat her [vomit](vomit.md) 
10. ...eat her [excreta](feces.md)
11. "...and so on."[^1]
16. ...lie still for a while and contemplate nothing but the pleasure derived from ingestion.

## Footnotes

[^1]: Ideas: given that wash-water is such a big thing here, having to drink her enema would fit. Also, collecting her sweat would go along with the "gunk" and armpit part of Ritual 6a]
