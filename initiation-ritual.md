As far as we can tell, Tantra originated in a matriarchal/matrilocal hill tribe, such as those still found in the hills of West Bengal and in neighboring states, and that this tribe was organized into 7 [later 8] kulas, or clans, each named for one of the 7 [or 8] Matrikas or Divine Mothers. The women in a given clan were all related to each other: mothers, daughters, sisters, cousins, aunts, nieces, etc. Male children were married off to other clans and husbands married in from other clans and became members of their wives' clan.

The purpose of the initiation ceremony was to bind male outsiders to their new wives and their new clan by magically/spiritually converting them from outsiders into true clan members. This was done through the magic of the "Kula," the clan essence, which was believed to flow from the Goddess Herself through the Matrika or Divine Mother of that clan to the Yogini or Messengers, wild birdlike spirits that also took possession of the women in the clan on ceremonial occasions. After a wild, intoxicating nighttime ritual in a sacred place, the men would be called on to

1.  please the women (at that point already possessed by Yogini) by bringing them to orgasm
    
2.  drink their vaginal fluids (the Kula)
    
3.  "make an offering of semen" to the women/Yogini.
    

The act of imbibing the Kula, the sexual discharge from the women, was believed to transform the men physically and spiritually into members of the new clan. The offering of semen, on the other hand, was to enable the Yogini to fly. Semen was considered a potent substitute for human flesh, and each man was warned that if he did not ejaculate and offer his semen to his partner, his body would be torn to shreds and eaten by the Yogini to supply them with the power of flight.

The tantras don't say exactly how the three steps were to be done, but there is a rich tradition of oral sex, particularly cunnilingus, in early tantra, so that seems likely to be the method for steps one and two. Step three could have been been either by fellatio and swallowing or by simple penetrative sex and orgasm. I suspect the latter, but the Sanskrit word used in the texts translates as "orifice," which could mean vagina or mouth, and was used for both.

After initiation, the men were promoted from candidates to "Vira," or Virile Heroes, and were considered to be apprentice sorcerers, ready and able to learn the clan ("Kula") magic.
