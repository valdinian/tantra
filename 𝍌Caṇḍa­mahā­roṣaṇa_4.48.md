> They are girls who can grant true accomplishment
After merely a fortnight’s application.
Their sexual fluid is vajra‍—
One should lick it all with one’s tongue.
One should drink their urine as one pleases,
Placing one’s face on their bhaga.
Or, indeed, placing the face on the lotus of their anus,
One should eat, as one pleases, their feces.
One must not feel any disgust, not even a little,
Otherwise one will lose one’s accomplishment.
This private food is the best,
Eaten by all the buddhas.
