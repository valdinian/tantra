2. have sex in the elephant trunk postion, gently, while visualizing
3. when he orgasms he should say this mantra: hraiṃ tvaiṃ rīṃ cate vata citte reto muñca 2 rīṃ klaiṃ hraiṃ
4. He should rub his semen mixed with gold, camphor and saffron on his own body: [his] beauty will become moon-like

He should dry _brahmamaṇḍūkī_ together with its roots in the shade. He should mix it with grape-juice, candied sugar and ghee.  He should have it three times [a day] for three months in portions measuring a dice as food and drink and he should drink milk. 

His semen will not deteriorate in millions of years if he practises this. His [semen] will never ever wane. It is for the rejuvenation of the body, O Priyā.

This is the secret of alchemy. He should not reveal it to others. This secret of the Siddha tradition, which is difficult to obtain, has now been taught. It is to be revealed through the compassion of the guru. What else do you wish to hear? (40.69)
