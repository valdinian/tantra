## History
[[lineages]]
### 1.) Kula
- A Dualistic Gift exchange
- Give
	- Mantras, mudras, and ritual actions to get divine's attention and get them to possess actors.
	- Gift exchangeSexual pleasure also experienced by the gods
- Get
	- Magical potency at least for a short period, but potentially for longer if you knew how to turn that magical energy into a specific magical power (siddhi).
### 2.) Shaivit & Shaktic 5-6 C.
- Non-Dual: you can' invite or entice a god to enter your body...because it's already there. Pleasure then (drinking wine, eating meat, and having great sex) is always puja.
- Split: Shaktists were fine with a female godhead, but Shaivists wern't and said Kula flowed from Shiva to Shakti,
- Split: dual and non-dual forms of Shaktism and Shaivism

#### Empowerment
[[empowerment-ritual]]
Who: inversion of social regulations, sexual yoga often recommends the usage of consorts from the most taboo groups available, such as close relatives or people from the lowest, most contaminated [castes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varna_(Hinduism) "Varna (Hinduism)"). They must be young and beautiful, as well as initiates in tantra
#### Semen Retention
#### Fluids as Offerings
Goal: generate sexual fluids which are the "preferred offering of the Tantric deities."
#### Consumption of Fluids
9th century Buddhist text Candamaharosana-tantra, which advocated consumption of bodily waste products of the practitioner's sexual partner, like wash-water of her anus and genitalia. Those were thought to be "power substances", teaching the waste should be consumed as a diet "eaten by all the Buddhas."[ Flood, Gavin D. (2006). The Tantric Body, The Secret Tradition of Hindu Religion.  pp.¬†84‚Äì85.]

#### Retention
Buddhist Tantric works further directed the focus away from sexual emission towards retention and intentionally prolonged bliss, thus "interiorizing" the tantric offering of fluids directed to the deities
