yoginīs
**dūtī** : Tantric Buddhist abhiṣeka 

> This list may be contrasted with David WHITE’s misleading eight-point polythetic definition of yoginīs (2003: 27), which includes these three points: 
> “(2) their power was intimately connected to the flow of blood, both their own sexual and menstrual emissions, and the blood of their animal (and human?) victims; 
> (3) they were essential to Tantric initiation in which they initiated male practitioners through fluid transactions via their ‘mouths’; and 
> (8) they were never portrayed as practicing yoga for the simple reason that yoga as we know it had not yet been invented.” 
> The last of these is bizarrely wrong; the first is confused, and the middle one has no basis in Tantric Śaivism whatsoever (WHITE may here be thinking of the **dūtī** in Tantric Buddhist abhiṣeka initiation rites; but this hardly characterizes Tantra in general). HATLEY comments: “There is undoubtedly a sanguinary dimension to the cult of yoginīs, and to the powers attributed to their most dangerous varieties. But as for yoginīs’ ‘sexual and menstrual emissions,’ the supposed significance of these remains mysterious to me; while the fluids of female practitioners are certainly significant in some rituals, the women concerned are seldom referred to as ‘yoginīs,’ while references in primary sources to the fluids of yoginīs, as goddesses, appear rare and ambiguous [at best]. Similarly, I am presently unaware of a Śaiva tradition in which yoginīs—presumably WHITE has in mind female ritual consorts—were ‘essential to Tantric initiation,’ and certainly not one in which they transacted with initiands in the manner suggested” (2007: 11n33).
