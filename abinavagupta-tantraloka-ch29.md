## Requirments
## Steps

Preliminary rites: 
1. The Adept procures a woman who is wanton. 
2. He places her in the mandala and 
3. offers her a narcotic drink. 
4. He places her on his left thigh and 
5. honours her yoni which is to be unshaven. 
6. He anoints the yoni with red sandalwood paste to appear bloody.
7. He gives her wine to drink. 
8. He paints a 'half-moon', ardhacandra, on her forehead with vermilion. 
9. He places his hands on her breasts and mutters the bhagabija [which Schoterman identifies with the mayabija HRIM]. 
10. He kisses her on the cheeks and moulds her breasts. 
11. He recites the mantra or a stotra. 
12. The sakti anoints the linga with sandal paste and saffron 

Central ritual: 
1. The Adept conducts the ritual coition. 
2. "The object of ... this ritual coition is the production of the fluid called *Tattva Uttama* ... or *Yonitattva*.' 
 
Concluding Rite: 
1. The Adept pays his respects to the yonimandala and to the guru. 
2. He utters some final lines expressing that he has accomplished his purpose and has been saved from samsara. Schoterman notes, opcit. pp.28-29, that the point of the ritual is to secure the yonitattva which has two applications: 
	a. The Adept uses it to form his tilaka in his daily ritual. 
	b. He uses it to worship the sakti in three stages. 
		Firstly he worships the yoni with water used for cleansing the yoni and the linga. 
		Secondly, he offers the vessel containing the yonitattva to the sakti. This is then divided into three parts of which the Adept presents one part to the sakti while he himself drinks the other two parts mixed with wine.
