> | When (yat) [the yogin] wants to enjoy (bhuñjīyāt) a woman, O Goddess, visualising himself as Śiva [and her as] Śakti,22 he should always have sex with a Yoginī or with a Māyā [type of woman], and never with a Pāśavī [i.e. a paśu-natured woman, or more precisely someone who has not been initiated]. ([[Matsyendrasaṃhitā]] 40.38)

> | He should not follow the path of the _paśu_s [i.e. that of the uninitiated] (MaSaṃ 40.34)

> | [Concerning] brutish non-initiates (paśus) who are bereft of gnosis, ill behaved, and without clan authorization: sexual union is not to be enjoyed by them, nor should they consume the fluid (dravyam).50 The wise [initiate] should consume the oblation [of sexual fluids]; one should not allow it to be given to pledges.51 [The mantra] hro hraḥ [effects the power of] extraction of the blood of the Yoginīs.52 The clan essence (kaulikam sāram), generated through intercourse with the Yoginīs, is not to be given away.53” (KJñN; WHite)
