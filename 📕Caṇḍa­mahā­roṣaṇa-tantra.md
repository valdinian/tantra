### Are the Sexual passages symbolic? No.
- The ancient scholar Mahāsukhavajra--in his commentary on Chapter 6--"severely attacks those who would think that the sexual imagery is merely symbolic, so he is well aware of tantric initiates who treat such practices in a subliminal and non-literal way. The vehemence of his tone suggests to us that he may have lived at a time when those with antinomian interpretations of the tantras were being pushed out by those taking a symbolic approach, perhaps as a compromise to social norms.
