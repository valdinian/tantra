Although there are early tantras that describe new initiates "making an offering of semen" during their initiation ritual, this was not an offering in the conventional sense of something being given up or destroyed to curry favor with a god. Semen and vaginal fluids were used primarily for magical purposes in tantric rituals. There were two distinct uses, initiation ceremonies and rituals designed to earn "siddhis," or magical powers.



**What About the Gods?**




dual and non-dual forms of Shaktism and Shaivism 


[[panchamakara]]

Sexual fluids (semen, discharge) generated via tantra were magical/powerful. Deposited in an open flame or oriface (mouth, vagina).


## History
1. Hill tribes (matriarchal clan essense)
2. -> lowland Shaktist and Shaivist sects. This induced two splits. First, Shaktists were fine with a female godhead, but Shaivists (followers of Shiva) revised the story about the magical Kula essence so that the Kula flowed originally from Shiva to Shakti, and so on down the chain. Second, the split that already existed at the time between dual and non-dual forms of Shaktism and Shaivism (and other Hindu sects) also affected how the sexual rituals were perceived.

As for semen and vaginal fluids, you could put some of it in an open flame if you wanted to, but the preferred destination in the oldest ceremony we know of was an "orifice" – either a mouth or a vagina.


## Rituals
All in all, many or most of these tantric sex rituals were considered holy in the past. And both critical body organs, fluids received great respect in all three stages..

1.  Preparation (*puja*, literally praying each other's yoni and lingam with great appreciation and invocation by leveraging laws of attraction)
2.  Act (Allowing possession of body to yogini by devotion during sex)
3.  Conclusion ... (a). . offer one part of these magical fluids to invoked gods and then Receive back and consume rest as sacraments. AND /OR (b) .. Offer in Flame option, something like agnihotra/homaor yagya/yagna in formal setting?
    
## Limitations
These days due to condoms and other techniques used out of fear from pregnancy/ disease, some connectivity is already weak. At least as intended compared to old times.

Things improper to do are proper for him. The follower of the mantra path must not think in terms of ‘fit to visit’ and ‘unfit to visit’; ‘edible’ and ‘inedible’; ‘desirable’ and ‘undesirable’; or ‘drinkable’ and ‘undrinkable.’
